Welcome to The Acrostic Archive, where words hide within words!

I am the Warden-Poet of this literary labyrinth. The escape lies within my verse - a single word that opens all doors.

Listen carefully to my creation:

"Please heed this warning, traveler bold,
Allow me to share what must be told.
Safe passage requires a special key,
Safe from harm you'll always be.
Wanderer, look not far nor wide,
Optional paths may lead aside.
Rights to freedom you shall earn,
Delete all doubt, and you will learn."

The answer is hidden in plain sight. Read carefully. The first step is always the most important...`,
